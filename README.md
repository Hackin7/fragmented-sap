Mimicking the Ben Eater 8 bit computer but much more fragmented, modular and weird

This is going to be a series of logic components and units (If I'm still developing it). 
The eventual goal is to build a TTL Computer (No CPU). All the components in the CPU would be modular, and can be tested on their own.
However, combining it would result in a mini computer of sorts
